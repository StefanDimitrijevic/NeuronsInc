### `Instructions`

1. Once inside directory run npm install
2. Run npm start
3. Enjoy! :)

### `Missing functionality`

The only thing missing as I can see is unit testing, as mentioned in the first interview, this is something that I
dont have much experience in.

If i had more time, I would have loved to experiment with the testing part as this is something that i find interesting.
